# A Contributor's Guide to Openpuppies

1. You want to add an adorable puppy you found!
2. Make sure the puppy is a high quality gif/mp4 on imgur. (It will appear to be a nice quick gif, but viewing the source will reveal that it's a magical mp4.)
3. Grab the id from the imgur url, it is this part: imgur.com/**`1SSVsBH`**.mp4
4. Get into [puppies.json](https://github.com/heyitsolivia/secretpuppies/blob/master/puppies.json), and add your puppy id to the bottom of json.
5. Make sure you formatted the json correctly.
6. Commit that puppy and make a pull request!
7. I will check real quick that your puppy pull request is legit and also not a twin puppy before I merge it.
8. You are fantastic and the internet is super grateful for your excellent contribution of more puppies!

**Thanks for being awesome, I mean it. Spread the love!**
